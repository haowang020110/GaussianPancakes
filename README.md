## Overview

This software implements the regularized splatting process presented in our paper [Gaussian Pancakes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06128) to be presented at MICCAI'24. 

For the efficient differential Gaussian normal calculation submodule: https://github.com/smbonilla/gaussian-norms

### Cloning

To get started, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/smbonilla/GaussianPancakes.git
cd GaussianPancakes
```
### Environment Setup 

This repository includes an `environment.yml` file with pinned versions of packages. However, please note that this environment is very specific to our setup, and adjustments may be necessary depending on your CUDA version, GPU, or other hardware configurations.:

```bash
conda env create --file environment.yml
conda activate gs_gnorms
```

### Note on Environment Setup

The environment.yml file includes tightly pinned versions of key dependencies. However, please note that certain packages may require adjustments depending on your specific CUDA version and GPU setup. You may need to experiment with different package versions to find the right combination for your system.

For users on different hardware setups, it's possible to create a base environment using the original Gaussian Splatting repository: [Gaussian Splatting Repo](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting) and then manually install additional dependencies like FAISS, FFmpeg, NumPy, PickleShare, Pillow, PyTorch-MSSSIM, TensorBoard, LPIPS, and the custom gaussian-norms submodule.

### Hardware and Software Requirements (similar to 3D GS)
- **CUDA-ready GPU** with Compute Capability 7.0+ 
- **Minimum 24 GB VRAM** 
- **C++ Compiler** for PyTorch extensions 
- **CUDA SDK 11.3 or higher** (ensure compatibility with the GPU and PyTorch version)
  - We used **CUDA 11.3**, but other versions may work with adjustments.
- Ensure your **C++ Compiler and CUDA SDK** are compatible with each other and PyTorch (the custom gaussian norms package may not build if they are not).

### Initialization

Please note that we **cannot provide access to the RNNSLAM codebase**, as it is private and not part of this repository. This codebase assumes a similar dataset initialization to COLMAP, but with an additional folder for depth maps (`depths`) and a slightly different camera pose format. 

The expected file format for the dataset is:

```
dataset_root/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ depths/               # Directory containing depth maps (e.g., .png files)
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ images/               # Directory containing image frames
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ camera_poses.txt      # TUM format pose file:
â”‚                         # timestamp tx ty tz qx qy qz qw
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ cameras.txt           # Camera information with the format:
â”‚                         # CAMERA_ID, MODEL, WIDTH, HEIGHT, PARAMS[]
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ points3D.ply          # 3D points in PLY format
```

While we cannot release the RNNSLAM code, the dataset setup follows a similar structure to COLMAP with minor adjustments.

### Running 

```python
python train.py -s <path to RNNSLAM Dataset>
```

Refer to the Gaussian Splatting Repo for command line arguments detailed, we only added a few arguments regarding weights on normal calculation, when to start normal calculation, and if skipping normal calculation. otherwise refer to command line detailed: https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting 

### Evaluation

All experiments with arguments and evaluation were run using `evaluate.py`.
